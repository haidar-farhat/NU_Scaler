Nu Scaler is a modern desktop application designed to upscale and enhance images and video frames. It aims to provide high-quality results using smart, performance-optimized algorithms that work locally on your machine.

Built with a clean and intuitive interface, Nu Scaler helps users improve visual quality without needing expensive hardware or a constant internet connection. It's especially useful for gamers, streamers, and content creators dealing with low resolution, poor frame rate, or slow internet speeds.

### Architecture Overview

Nu Scaler follows a hybrid architecture combining Python and Rust to balance performance and flexibility. The user interface is built using PySide6 (Qt for Python), offering a modern and responsive cross-platform GUI. Behind the scenes, the heavy lifting is done in Rust, where advanced upscaling and frame interpolation algorithms are executed using WGPU-powered shaders for GPU acceleration. This separation allows the GUI to remain responsive while the computationally intensive tasks are offloaded to efficient, low-level Rust modules, ensuring both speed and stability across different systems.

### NU's Features

- Nu Scaler is packed with powerful features designed for both performance and usability. It leverages GPU-accelerated upscaling using Rust and WGPU shaders, delivering fast, high-quality results even on modest hardware. The application features a sleek and responsive interface built with PySide6, making it intuitive and cross-platform. Users can upscale images or video frames entirely offline, preserving privacy and eliminating the need for cloud-based processing. With support for frame interpolation, Nu Scaler can boost the smoothness of videos, making it ideal for gaming or streaming scenarios. Batch processing, drag-and-drop functionality, and a modular architecture make it efficient for everyday use while also extensible for advanced workflows.

// The line including bindgen-generated bindings has been removed.
// Manual FFI definitions should be directly in this file or its modules.

// You can add `pub use` statements here if you want to re-export specific items
// from the generated bindings for easier access by other crates.
// For example:
// pub use self::SlStatus; // Assuming SlStatus is generated in bindings.rs
// pub use self::slInitializeSDK; // Assuming slInitializeSDK is generated

// Any custom Rust helper functions or structs that operate on these FFI types
// can also be defined here if needed.
